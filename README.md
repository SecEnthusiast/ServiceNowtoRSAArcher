# ServiceNowtoRSAArcher
Individual integration of components from ServiceNow into RSA Archer or BI tools (Qlick, PowerBI, Tipco)

Goals
- Extract tickets from SNOW into a file for standardized import into various GRC, BI or reporting tools.
- Extract from ServiceNow API (table)
- Don't use RSA Archer Data Feed HTTPS function because of import functionality for other BI Tools (PowerBI, TIBCO Spotfire Analytics, etc.)
- Standardization of the fields and renaming of field names so that the input (xml file) can be made available to various tools
- Log file creation for subsequent verification

Future Plans

Replace XML with JSON
Clean up script
